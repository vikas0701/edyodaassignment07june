db and radius are ClusterIP as we don't want user to access it.
result and vote are NodePort so user can access them.
[root@ip-172-31-30-127 k8s-specifications]#kubectl delete po vote-94849dc97-pfnx2
  -> as old pod went away new pod got created so application is running fine and desired=current is maintain.
[root@ip-172-31-30-127 k8s-specifications]#kubectl delete po worker-dd46d7584-gk5r2 
  -> old pod terminating and new pod got created so application is running fine.
[root@ip-172-31-30-127 k8s-specifications]#kubectl delete po db-b54cd94f4-bdlr4
  -> db pod is deleted and after deleting db nod, result app is not working fine or not giving proper 
result so simply we can just restart result app by deleting result app.
-> deleting db app result in loss of data and result app app is not giving proper result so result app restarted.
-> when worker was deleted all previous logs are lost.
